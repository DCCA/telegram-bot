# Simple Telegram Bot API

I created a simple API bot using a Node.JS server.
This bots returns you the price of a current crypto currency with de price variation for the last 1 day, 7 days, 30 days and 365 days.

## To use

1. Create your bot using the /BotFather interface in Telegram
2. Clone this project and do a `npm install`
3. Add "TELEGRAM_API" and "NOMICS_API" to your environment variables with your API Keys
4. Set up a web hook using the /setWebhook
5. You are ready to go :D
